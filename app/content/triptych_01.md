Triptych ...
====================================
A triptych (/ˈtrɪptɪk/ TRIP-tik; from the Greek adjective τρίπτυχον ("three-fold"), from tri, i.e., "three" and ptysso, i.e., "to fold" or ptyx, i.e., "fold") is a work of art (usually a panel painting) that is divided into three sections, or three carved panels which are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction was $142.4 million for a 1969 triptych, "Three Studies of Lucian Freud", by Francis Bacon. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry.
